- 👋 Hi, I’m @DarrylWilliams32
- 👀 I’m interested in Android App Development and Web Development via Wordpress.
- 🌱 I have experience with html, css, php, javascript, kotlin, and ruby. I can also use tools such as bootstrap and local to quickly implement Wordpress sites. I use Android           studio to quickly and efficiently deploy andoid apps. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on small Android app projects to gain more experience/build portfolio
- 📫 I can best be reached at my email: DarrylWilliams6@Gmail.com
